> *"Governance doesn't just scale between strategic and tactical levels — it fractures at the institutional seams between allied actors. Those fractures are the gray zone. Auracelle WinterStorm2030 is designed to expose that space dynamically, making the invisible seams visible, measurable, and actionable so decision-makers can close them before adversaries walk through."*

## Overview

Auracelle WinterStorm2030 is a browser-based governance capacity working instrument built for NATO STO SAS-219 High North Scenarios for Wargaming and Analysis (Winter Storm 2030). It exposes and maps **gray zone governance fractures** in the Arctic High North — the institutional seams between allied actors that adversaries calibrate their operations to exploit before governance can recognize and respond.

The platform is powered by the **E-IAIG-HT** framework — the sole governing mathematical intelligence architecture for WinterStorm2030. It is distinct from the E-AGPO-HT framework, which governs other Auracelle platform deployments (Bach, Charlie, Orion, Mozart).

## The Gray Zone Governance Problem

WinterStorm2030 addresses a gap that neither strategic foresight nor operational wargaming currently fills:

| Layer | Existing Tools | Gap |
|---|---|---|
| Strategic Foresight | Horizon scanning, futures narratives | Cannot measure whether institutions will be capable of governing when futures arrive |
| Operational Wargaming | Force posture, kinetic scenario design | Assumes governance holds — does not model governance as a dynamic variable |
| **Gray Zone Governance** | **WinterStorm2030 (E-IAIG-HT)** | **Maps where governance fractures, how fast, and what adversaries do with those fractures** |

## Platform Architecture

### Navigation Tabs

| Tab | Function |
|---|---|
| **Overview** | Mission context, gray zone thesis, SAS-219 integration status |
| **Demo** | Pre-configured scenario demonstrations across five sub-panels |
| **Scenario Input** | Live actor selection, action type, and scenario narrative entry |
| **Actor Analysis** | g-GWC baseline profiles across all 8 BGC domains including CD |
| **Agentic Foresight** | Live E-IAIG-HT agentic analysis via Anthropic API |
| **Narrative Analysis** | Governance-aware narrative assessment |
| **Foresight Comms** | AI-generated institutional interventions |
| **Live Tracking** | Bayesian/Kalman governance degradation tracking |
| **KPIs / Success Criteria** | Five approaches, panel KPIs, WS2030 KPIs, live demo |
| **Governance Lab** | Document upload and E-IAIG-HT gray zone analysis |

### E-IAIG-HT Mathematical Architecture

The framework operates across three strata:

```
Stratum III  →  g-GWC          General Governance Wargaming Capacity (0–100)
Stratum II   →  8 BGC Domains  STI | SAD | ESI | NDM | SRA | IIC | ASI | CD★
Stratum I    →  ~48 NOFs       Normalized Operational Factors (incl. 8 CD-NOFs)
```

**★ Cognitive Domain (CD)** — 8th BGC domain, integrated April 2026. Governs institutional capacity to recognize and counter adversarial cognitive operations, maskirovka, and decision-maker perception manipulation.

#### Arctic-Calibrated g-GWC Equation

```
g-GWC = Σ [ w_j × BGC_j × (1 + ACC_j × AI_readiness_j) ]

Arctic weights:
ESI: 0.190  |  NDM: 0.165  |  IIC: 0.155  |  CD: 0.130
ASI: 0.130  |  SRA: 0.115  |  SAD: 0.060  |  STI: 0.055
```

### Arctic Actor Baselines (April 2026)

| Actor | g-GWC | IIC | ASI | ESI | CD★ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Norway | 74.8 | 73 | 65 | 75 | 61 |
| Finland | 75.6 | 76 | 68 | 72 | 64 |
| Sweden | 73.0 | 74 | 64 | 71 | 60 |
| Denmark/Greenland | 68.7 | 70 | 58 | 68 | 55 |
| Iceland | 59.3 | 42 | 56 | 58 | **38 ⚠** |
| Russia (Adversarial) | 80.2 | 88 | 74 | 80 | **82** |

**Critical seam:** Russia CD (82) vs Iceland CD (38) = 44-point gray zone window. Russian maskirovka is calibrated to operate below Iceland's cognitive classification threshold while Norway has already recognized the operation as adversarial.

## Features

### Governance Lab
Upload treaties, agreements, conflict histories, and policy documents. Each document is processed through the E-IAIG-HT gray zone governance lens via the Anthropic API, extracting:
- **Governance Seam** — where institutional frameworks fracture between actors
- **Gray Zone Condition** — the below-threshold operational space the document creates
- **Actor Intelligence** — governance posture and vulnerabilities of specific actors
- **Scenario Inject** — a calibrated Winter Storm 2030 scenario inject derived from the document

Pre-loaded: Svalbard Treaty (1920), NATO Article 5 Washington Treaty (1949).

### KPI / Success Criteria Framework
Five approaches to defining wargame success, with live demos of all five WinterStorm2030-specific KPIs:
1. Governance Baseline Coverage (100% actors, all 8 domains)
2. CD Scenario Activation Rate (≥50% of injects)
3. Governance Seam Identification Yield (≥2 novel seams/cycle)
4. Bayesian/Kalman Tracking Fidelity (≥0.70 correlation)
5. Backwards-Engineering Success Rate (≥80% traceability)

### Live E-IAIG-HT Agentic Analysis
Real-time governance capacity assessment via the Anthropic Claude API. Actors, action types, and scenario narratives are processed through the E-IAIG-HT framework to produce structured governance impact assessments.
